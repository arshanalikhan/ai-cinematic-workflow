note: I didn't used clothing in prompt 1 because it was going to be black & white, so there won't be much difference


# Scene 2: 

A cinematic close-up shot of a young Indian man with glasses and black sweater sitting on a park bench next to a young woman with long hair and blue sweater. The woman is turning her head, looking directly at the man's face with a soft, affectionate, and longing expression. The man is looking down at his lap, avoiding eye contact, with a shy and introverted expression. Soft natural lighting, green bokeh background, emotional atmosphere, photorealistic, 8k.


# Scene 3: 

The New Pose:
They are sitting upright, side-by-side, looking straight ahead out at the park landscape. Their heads are held straight or tilted very slightly towards the view, but they are not touching. There is a clear, distinct gap of space between their heads and shoulders. They have independent postures.
The Background:A lush green park bathed in bright, warm golden hour sunlight. The background trees are softly blurred with warm bokeh lighting. Photorealistic, 8k.

# Scene 4:

A cinematic close-up shot, angled from the side.

The Subjects:
Foreground (In Sharp Focus): The young woman with long hair (wearing a blue textured sweater) is on the left side of the frame. She is looking down with a sad, heartbroken expression, lips slightly parted. High detail on her face.
Background (Blurred/Bokeh): The young Indian man (wearing a black sweater) is visible over her shoulder on the right side. He is out of focus (bokeh). He is looking down.
The Mood: Melancholic, emotional, and quiet. Soft, diffused lighting (overcast day). Photorealistic, 8k, shallow depth of field.

The Composition (Crucial for "Side-by-Side"):
The camera looks down at the space between two people sitting very close together. We can see the fabric of blue denim jeans on the left (woman's lap) and dark trousers on the right (man's lap) at the very bottom edge of the frame. The hands are resting on the wood slats between their legs.
The Hands:

Male Hand (Right Side): use the image provided, Resting flat on the bench. Fair skin, subtle natural veins. Wrist covered by a black knit sweater sleeve.
